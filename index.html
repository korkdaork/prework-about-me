      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>I work for the State of Calfironia and I am a contract and project manager.  
        I have always been interested in coding and web development but never focused my studies on it.  
        I graduated from U.C. Berkeley with a BA in Legal Studies.</p>
      
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      
      <p>I was born in Siberia (Russia).  I called Sacramento home the longest.</p>
      
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      
      <p>Art (doodling, drawing, painting, etc.), Video Games, Reading (or audio books at times), 
        Traveling, Eating, and going places of Nature (Lakes, Parks, Hiking, etc.), 
        socializing (i.e. hanging out with friends, going for happy hour, etc.)</p>
      
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      
      <p>My dream job is working somewhere where I feel fullfilled.  
        I haven't really thought about a job after completing the coding course, 
        but I do want to work somewhere where I can utilize my new skills and still cover the 
        cost of living (i.e. make the same or as close as possible to what I make rigt now).</p>
      
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      
      <p>I currently reside in El Dorado Hills, California.</p>
      
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      
      <p>I find it interesting and there is always a demand.  
        However, I would like to eventually expand my coding knowledge to have the ability 
        to code software applications, etc.</p>
